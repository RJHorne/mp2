# Mini Project 2


Please create a python application that evidences your understanding of lectures/workshops 7-11. Your code could be broken down into several applications if you feel that is a better way to demonstrate understanding of the key principles. This assignment has an expected workload allocation of 10 hours for you to complete, please ensure you give it plenty of time to make a cohesive project. 

Please use this codespace : 

 - [ ] **Regular Expressions**
	 Basic - Partial Evidence shown, limited depth in the usage of regex
	 Complete - Full Evidence shown of regex with different filters and functions used
 - [ ] **Testing**
		*Basic* - Some basic testing of functions provided 
		*Complete* - All functions that can be tested are tested, with individualised tests with a reasonable number of test 				conditions
 - [ ] **Libraries**
	 Basic - Partial Evidence shown, singular extra library implemented only
	 Complete - Full Evidence shown, including your own library made
 - [ ] **File I/O**
	 Basic - Partial Evidence shown, potentially read or write
	 Complete - Full Evidence shown of reading and writing to .txt or .csv files
 - [ ] **Object Orientated Programming**
	 Basic - Partial Evidence shown, potentially missing more than one class or inheritance from a super class. 
	 Complete - Full Evidence shown of classes and inheritance.
 - [ ] **Above and beyond**
	 An opportunity for you to expand on the taught content and show extra knowledge, evidencing python outside of the categories taught will warrant these extension marks.  	 


Each principle will receive up to 15 points. However, the quality will determine the number of marks awarded. 

Basic - 7 Points
Complete - 15 Points

There is an additional 10 marks available for adding suitable comments added to your code. Comments should provide clear insight to how the code is functioning.
